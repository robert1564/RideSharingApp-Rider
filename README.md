# cab_rider

This is a RideSharingApp for Android devices, developed in Flutter and the database is created in Firebase.

Can be run on both android and iOS devices, due to Flutter language, which give my the opportunity to run on two platform without having to make a major changes in my code. App is divided into two parts: rider part and driver part. 

From rider side: 
  - User can order a car;
  - See the nearby cars available on the map;
  - See the overall route;
  - See the auto-generated price for the trip;
  - Time until the driver arrive to the indicated location;
  - Can call the driver after he pick it up the trip;
